## Opening — Inaugural Address

[NOTE — 20 January 1961. Washington, D.C. Temperature: 22 °F / −6 °C. The crowd is vast. Speak slowly — your breath will be visible in the cold air.]

[CLICK]

Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, reverend clergy, fellow citizens: [BREATHE]

[PAUSE — let the formalities settle. Survey the crowd.]

We observe today not a victory of party [BREATHE] but a celebration of freedom — [BREATHE] symbolizing an end as well as a beginning — [BREATHE] signifying renewal as well as change.

[PAUSE — let the opening land]

For I have sworn before you and Almighty God [BREATHE] the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.

[PAUSE]

The world is very different now. [BREATHE] For man holds in his mortal hands [SLOW] the power to abolish all forms of human poverty [BREATHE] and all forms of human life.

[PAUSE — hold the weight of that contrast. 3–4 seconds.]

And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought [BREATHE] are still at issue around the globe — [BREATHE] the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state [BREATHE] but from the hand of God.

[PAUSE]

**We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.** [BREATHE]

[PAUSE — let this declaration resonate]

Let the word go forth from this time and place, [BREATHE] to friend and foe alike, [BREATHE] that the torch has been passed [SLOW] to a new generation of Americans — [BREATHE]

[PAUSE — 3 seconds. This is one of the speech's defining images.]

born in this century, [BREATHE] tempered by war, [BREATHE] disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, [BREATHE] proud of our ancient heritage — [BREATHE] and unwilling to witness or permit [BREATHE] the slow undoing of those human rights to which this Nation has always been committed, [BREATHE] and to which we are committed today [BREATHE] at home and around the world.

[PAUSE]

Let every nation know, [BREATHE] whether it wishes us well or ill, [BREATHE] that we shall pay any price, [BREATHE] bear any burden, [BREATHE] meet any hardship, [BREATHE] support any friend, [BREATHE] oppose any foe, [BREATHE] **in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.**

[PAUSE — 4 seconds. The cadence of that list should build and then land hard on the final clause.]

## Pledges to the World

[CLICK]

[NOTE — This section addresses allies and adversaries in turn. Keep the tone firm but generous — these are pledges, not threats.]

To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, [BREATHE] we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. [BREATHE] United, there is little we cannot do [BREATHE] in a host of cooperative ventures. [BREATHE] Divided, there is little we can do — [BREATHE] for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.

[PAUSE]

To those new States whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, [BREATHE] we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away [BREATHE] merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.

[PAUSE]

We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. [BREATHE] But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom — [BREATHE] and to remember that, in the past, [BREATHE] those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger [BREATHE] ended up inside.

[PAUSE — let the metaphor land. Brief smile if appropriate.]

[CLICK]

To those peoples in the huts and villages across half the globe [BREATHE] struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, [BREATHE] we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, [BREATHE] for whatever period is required — [BREATHE] not because the Communists may be doing it, [BREATHE] not because we seek their votes, [BREATHE] but because it is right.

[PAUSE]

**If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, [BREATHE] it cannot save the few who are rich.**

[PAUSE — 3 seconds. This line often gets applause. Wait for it.]

[CLICK]

To our sister republics south of our border, [BREATHE] we offer a special pledge — [BREATHE] to convert our good words into good deeds, [BREATHE] in a new alliance for progress, [BREATHE] to assist free men and free governments [BREATHE] in casting off the chains of poverty.

[PAUSE]

But this peaceful revolution of hope [BREATHE] cannot become the prey of hostile powers. [BREATHE] Let all our neighbors know [BREATHE] that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion [BREATHE] anywhere in the Americas.

[PAUSE]

And let every other power know [BREATHE] that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.

[PAUSE — firm. Brief.]

## To the United Nations and Our Adversaries

[CLICK]

To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, [BREATHE] our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war [BREATHE] have far outpaced the instruments of peace, [BREATHE] we renew our pledge of support — [BREATHE]

to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective — [BREATHE] to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak — [BREATHE] and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.

[PAUSE]

[CLICK]

[NOTE — The tone shifts here. You are addressing the Soviet Union directly. Measured, not hostile.]

Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, [BREATHE] we offer not a pledge but a request: [BREATHE]

that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, [BREATHE] before the dark powers of destruction [BREATHE] unleashed by science [BREATHE] engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.

[PAUSE — 3 seconds]

We dare not tempt them with weakness. [BREATHE] For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt [BREATHE] can we be certain beyond doubt [BREATHE] that they will never be employed.

[PAUSE]

But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations [BREATHE] take comfort from our present course — [BREATHE] both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, [BREATHE] both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, [BREATHE] yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror [BREATHE] that stays the hand of mankind's final war.

[PAUSE — let the gravity build]

## A Call to Negotiate

[CLICK]

**So let us begin anew** — [BREATHE] [LOOK UP]

remembering on both sides [BREATHE] that civility is not a sign of weakness, [BREATHE] and sincerity is always subject to proof.

[PAUSE]

Let us never negotiate out of fear. [BREATHE] **But let us never fear to negotiate.**

[PAUSE — 4 seconds. One of the most quoted lines. Let it breathe fully.]

Let both sides explore what problems unite us [BREATHE] instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.

[PAUSE]

Let both sides, for the first time, [BREATHE] formulate serious and precise proposals [BREATHE] for the inspection and control of arms — [BREATHE] and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations [BREATHE] under the absolute control of all nations.

[PAUSE]

Let both sides seek to invoke [BREATHE] the wonders of science instead of its terrors. [BREATHE] Together let us explore the stars, [BREATHE] conquer the deserts, [BREATHE] eradicate disease, [BREATHE] tap the ocean depths, [BREATHE] and encourage the arts and commerce.

[PAUSE]

[CLICK]

Let both sides unite [BREATHE] to heed in all corners of the earth [BREATHE] the command of Isaiah — [SLOW] to "undo the heavy burdens [BREATHE] and to let the oppressed go free."

[PAUSE — 3 seconds]

And if a beachhead of cooperation [BREATHE] may push back the jungle of suspicion, [BREATHE] let both sides join in creating [BREATHE] a new endeavor — [BREATHE] not a new balance of power, [BREATHE] but a new world of law, [BREATHE] where the strong are just [BREATHE] and the weak secure [BREATHE] and the peace preserved.

[PAUSE — hold. This is the vision statement.]

## The Call to Service

[CLICK]

[NOTE — The speech pivots inward here. You are now addressing the American people directly. Warm but serious.]

All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. [BREATHE] Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, [BREATHE] nor in the life of this Administration, [BREATHE] nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. [BREATHE]

**But let us begin.**

[PAUSE — 3 seconds. Simple and powerful.]

[LOOK UP]

In your hands, my fellow citizens, [BREATHE] more than in mine, [BREATHE] will rest the final success or failure of our course. [BREATHE]

Since this country was founded, [BREATHE] each generation of Americans has been summoned [BREATHE] to give testimony to its national loyalty. [BREATHE]

The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service [BREATHE] surround the globe.

[PAUSE — respect the fallen. 3 seconds of silence.]

Now the trumpet summons us again — [BREATHE] not as a call to bear arms, [BREATHE] though arms we need; [BREATHE] not as a call to battle, [BREATHE] though embattled we are — [BREATHE] but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, [BREATHE] year in and year out, [BREATHE] "rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation" — [BREATHE]

a struggle against the common enemies of man: [BREATHE] tyranny, [BREATHE] poverty, [BREATHE] disease, [BREATHE] and war itself.

[PAUSE]

Can we forge against these enemies [BREATHE] a grand and global alliance, [BREATHE] North and South, [BREATHE] East and West, [BREATHE] that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? [BREATHE]

**Will you join in that historic effort?**

[PAUSE — 3 seconds. Look directly at the crowd.] [LOOK UP]

## Ask Not — The Closing

[CLICK]

[NOTE — This is the climax. Everything before has built to this moment. Slow right down. Every word lands.]

In the long history of the world, [BREATHE] only a few generations have been granted the role [BREATHE] of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. [BREATHE]

I do not shrink from this responsibility — [BREATHE] **I welcome it.** [BREATHE]

[PAUSE]

I do not believe that any of us [BREATHE] would exchange places with any other people [BREATHE] or any other generation. [BREATHE]

The energy, the faith, the devotion [BREATHE] which we bring to this endeavor [BREATHE] will light our country [BREATHE] and all who serve it — [BREATHE]

and the glow from that fire [BREATHE] can truly light the world. [SLOW]

[PAUSE — 4 seconds. Let the image settle.]

[CLICK]

And so, my fellow Americans: [PAUSE] [LOOK UP]

**Ask not what your country can do for you** [BREATHE] [SLOW]

**ask what you can do for your country.**

[PAUSE — the longest pause in the speech. 5–6 seconds. Look up. Hold the silence. Let the crowd respond.]

My fellow citizens of the world: [BREATHE] [LOOK UP]

ask not what America will do for you, [BREATHE] but what together [BREATHE] we can do [BREATHE] for the freedom of man.

[PAUSE — 4 seconds]

[CLICK]

[NOTE — The benediction. Slower still. This is the farewell.]

Finally, whether you are citizens of America [BREATHE] or citizens of the world, [BREATHE] ask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice [BREATHE] which we ask of you. [BREATHE]

With a good conscience our only sure reward, [BREATHE] with history the final judge of our deeds, [BREATHE] let us go forth to lead the land we love, [BREATHE] [SLOW]

asking His blessing and His help, [BREATHE] but knowing that here on earth [BREATHE] **God's work must truly be our own.**

[PAUSE — end. Hold the silence for a full 5 seconds before stepping back.] [SMILE]
